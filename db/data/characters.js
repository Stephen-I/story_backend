    Backstory:
      "When she was 5yrs of age, she lived in a village of dragon kin with her family and friends. They were a passive and quiet village of people living in peace but a corrupt noble in a nearby human settlement despised demi-humans and out of fear for the dragon kin’s natural abilities he ordered the slaughter of her people. As a result, on a peaceful day unlike any other, the dragon kin unaware of what was to come, were attacked by the humans. And before they could even react were wiped by artillery spells. With the buildings ravaged and the people wounded the knights charged killing any survivors accept for one lone girl trembling at bottom of the well that her mother threw her in before she perished. As the humans departed, the girl slowly emerged from her watery protector only to find nothing but despair at the sight of the charred bodies of her friends and family around her. This event forever traumatized her to the point that even the sight of another human caused her to tremble with fear, as she got older this fear turned into a heavy hatred which was deep seeded within her very soul in the form of pure darkness unknown to her, causing her left eye to permanently turn red. She then left her once prosperous village (with only a necklace her mum gave her to remember her by) to live in a nearby forest trying to live off nature and stealing from human camps as they slept for food to survive. As she struggled through her new life, she slowly discovered that she could use magic and after watching adventurers casting against monsters as well as remembering some of the ancestral spells she’d see her mother use, became very proficient at it herself. Shunned and scorned by society she survives forever alone.",
