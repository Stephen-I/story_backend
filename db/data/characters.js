    backstory:
      "He started out as part of the knightly order, but one day a noblemen ordered to annihilation of a remote village of peaceful demi-humans but at the time of conflict he refused to participate as he thought this act was wrong. This infuriated the noblemen and on return to the capital of Calphicorn, the noble lied to the king and made up the story that Jace fled from combat against an army of aggressive demi’s out to destroy the kingdom. As a result the king banished him from knighthood to forever be disgraced. It started as a petit vendetta against this noblemen but as he was no-longer a knight, this noblemen was out of his reach. Then a stranger dressed in a black robe approached him and made promises of being able to avenge his name and give the nobleman what he deserved and that all he had to do was steal a red crystal of unknown origin from the very noble he despised that was supposed to be given to the king as a treasure of the kingdom. This would cause the king to punish the noble in reaction. After Jace committed this act to give the noble what he deserved he regretted his actions immediately as the mysterious man took the crystal for it was actually a sealing stone with a powerful demon sealed away but before Jace could fix his mistake, the man in black released the demon sealed within. This resulted in a catastrophe like no other which caused the destruction  of the kingdom and majority of its inhabitants. After this event the man in black escaped along with the demon responsible. This event is forever known as the Calphicorn catastrophe and Jace was then dubbed “Jace the betrayer”.  14 years passed and Jace had now become a wandering sell sword to survive as no-one would employ him after the event. His only goal to find the black sorcerer and demon that tricked him and slay them both to clear his name.",

    backstory:
      "When she was 5yrs of age, she lived in a village of dragon kin with her family and friends. They were a passive and quiet village of people living in peace but a corrupt noble in a nearby human settlement despised demi-humans and out of fear for the dragon kin’s natural abilities he ordered the slaughter of her people. As a result, on a peaceful day unlike any other, the dragon kin unaware of what was to come, were attacked by the humans. And before they could even react were wiped by artillery spells. With the buildings ravaged and the people wounded the knights charged killing any survivors accept for one lone girl trembling at bottom of the well that her mother threw her in before she perished. As the humans departed, the girl slowly emerged from her watery protector only to find nothing but despair at the sight of the charred bodies of her friends and family around her. This event forever traumatized her to the point that even the sight of another human caused her to tremble with fear, as she got older this fear turned into a heavy hatred which was deep seeded within her very soul in the form of pure darkness unknown to her, causing her left eye to permanently turn red. She then left her once prosperous village (with only a necklace her mum gave her to remember her by) to live in a nearby forest trying to live off nature and stealing from human camps as they slept for food to survive. As she struggled through her new life, she slowly discovered that she could use magic and after watching adventurers casting against monsters as well as remembering some of the ancestral spells she’d see her mother use, became very proficient at it herself. Shunned and scorned by society she survives forever alone.",
